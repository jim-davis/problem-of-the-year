The "Problem of the Year"

Given four single digits, generate expressions that evaluate to the numbers from 1 to 100, using each of those four digits once only.  Any operators may be used.

It is permitted to concatenate digits, thus if the digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4, expressions such as 12 + 34 or 321 / 4 are allowed.

This program uses addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modular division, exponentiation, logarithm, square root, factorial, and absolute value operators.
