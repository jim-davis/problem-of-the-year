The "Problem of the Year".

Program to solve a math problem given to third and fourth graders in Ontario.  It's also used in the Spirit of Math program.

Given four single digits, generate expressions that evaluate to the numbers from 1 to 100, using each of those four digits once only.  

It is permitted to concatenate digits, thus if the digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4, expressions such as 12 + 34 or 321 / 4 are allowed.

For Spirit of Math the set of operators allowed is explicitly limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, and factorial.  Modular division, logarithm and absolute value operators are not allowed.
